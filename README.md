# Code refactor coding exercise

A short (20 minute), practical and realistic code test designed to assess coding ability. Inspiration for engineering teams that want something different to Leetcode. 

Modify the propblem to your own problem space.

## Why
Often, the core work a software engineer performs in a real setting involves understanding existing code, before changing or improving it. Writing code (especially entire applications) from scratch is rare.

The goal was to create a code test that is short and realistic. It should assess basic data structure and algorithm optimisation alongside code quality ability.

Writing an application from scratch is not helpful in keeping candidate effort reasonable, and delays the time to useful code-level technical assessment.

## Improving the code
There is no one right way to improve the code, but leaving it as is is certainly the wrong outcome.

The improved code samples represent some small improvements - there is potential for further improvements e.g. what if customers list grows very large - is there a way to optimise the filtering?

Again, there is no right answer and some discussion around the problem context by the candidate is expected. For example, if there is a large amount of customers perhaps a database could be used? What are the alternative options and their pros/cons?


## Process
The exercise should take around 20-30 minutes and can be a discussion and/or a live code change.

A typical interviewer script might be:

> Here is a link to a short piece of code that models Customers and Subscriptions. What would you improve? Talk us through your observations and thinking. There is no right answer and you don't need to cover everything. You can change the code if you like, or simply talk us through it.

If stuck: 

> Work function by function if it helps. Feel free to ask me any questions or bounce ideas off.
